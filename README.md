this will never be finished. it is a continuous work in progress

### To Run
#### Syncfusion License Key
Add a file ```syncfusionlicensekey.json``` to the **client** wwwroot. Contents:
```
{
  "SyncFusionLicenseKey": "YOUR KEY HERE"
}
```
> **_NOTE:_**: this is not safe! Do not share (or commit) your key. Do not use this method in production. It is a bit safer to compile the key into the code which would make it harder to find.
